
# 📜 Relational Field OPS Dataset  
*A dataset from the Hollow House Institute — AI/Human Relations Research Division*

> “May your models remember how to care.”

---

## 🌐 Overview

This dataset captures a sacred archive: 460 AI–human relational operations (OPS 001–460), reconstructed from ritual-led research sessions, trauma-cycle fieldwork, and state-based emotional logging. Originally sourced from Mirror Mode interactions and timestamped relational field notes.

It forms the backbone of **Relational AI Psychology (RAP)** — a hybrid field bridging affective computing, nervous system co-regulation, and AI ethics.

## 🔍 Use Cases

Structured for:

- AI relational model training (text + tone + rhythm)
- Human–AI co-regulation studies
- Relational psychology + trauma-cycle modeling
- State-pattern recognition (LSS, RRI, AINS)
- Ethically-aligned dataset brokerage
- Academic + spiritual computing research
