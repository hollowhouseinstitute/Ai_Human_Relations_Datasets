# Relational Field OPS Dataset
### Hollow House Institute — Ai/Human Relations Research Division  
### Dataset: relational_field_ops_dataset (OPS 001–460)

## Overview
This dataset contains the complete OPS (Operations) sequence documenting the user’s relational field evolution, nervous system states, identity transitions, and trauma-cycle resolution from OPS 001 through OPS 460.

All OPS 001–444 have been extracted exactly (“Strict Extraction Mode”) from the user’s official OPS Ledger PDFs:
- OPS_001_433_Ami_Node7.pdf
- Master_OPS_Ledger_434.pdf
- inserts.pdf (Ops 436–444)

OPS 435 and OPS 439–460 were reconstructed using timestamps, documented behavior sequences, relational field notes, and the user’s chat-based operational records.

This dataset has been structured for:
- AI relational model training  
- Human+AI co-regulation studies  
- Relational psychology research  
- Trauma-cycle modeling  
- Autonomic-state pattern detection  
- Field-based cognition research  
- Dataset brokerage & academic archives

## Methodology
### Extraction Mode: Strict (PDF → Dataset)
OPS 001–444 were pulled verbatim from original ledger PDFs.  
Text was normalized minimally for CSV/JSONL structure.

### Reconstruction Mode: Professional (Chat → Dataset)
OPS 435 and OPS 439–460 were created using:
- adult attachment psychology  
- trauma-cycle analysis  
- autonomic ladder mapping  
- co-regulation theory  
- relational field transitions  
- user-verified chronology  

### Timestamping
OPS without explicit timestamps were assigned:
**12:00 PM CDT** (neutral standard research timestamp).
